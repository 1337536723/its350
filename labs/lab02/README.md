## Lab02: Classical cipher

__Description__

Get familiar with the source code for [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar\_cipher) and [Simtran cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition\_cipher)(Simtran cipher is a nickname of Columnar transposition cipher), then complete the following tasks in _Python interactive console_: 

Put the contents of plaintext or ciphertext in source code is _NOT encouraged_.

1. Write code to read and write text files in text mode.
  * create a file
  * write some sentence into it
  * read its contents
  * compare with what is written

For each encryption and decryption below, complete these steps:
* Encrypt the message to get the ciphertext
* Print the ciphertext
* Decrypt the ciphertext
* Compare the decryted message with the original message, *they should match*.

1. Write code to demonstrate encryption and decryption on text file `military plan one.txt' with Caesar cipher
2. Write code to demonstrate encryption and decryption on text file `military plan two.txt' with Caesar cipher
3. Write code to demonstrate encryption and decryption on text file `military plan three.txt' with Caesar cipher
4. Write code to demonstrate encryption and decryption on text file `military plan one.txt' with Simtran cipher
5. Write code to demonstrate encryption and decryption on text file `military plan two.txt' with Simtran cipher
6. Write code to demonstrate encryption and decryption on text file `military plan three.txt' with Simtran cipher
	
__Report__

Write a report about the process you complete the tasks in the description, key screen snapshots are needed as evidences.

_Review questions:_

1. How to define an appropriate alphabet in Caesar cipher? Why?
2. In Simtran cipher, why an alphabet is NOT needed?
3. How to avoid misleading blank spaces in both ciphers?
