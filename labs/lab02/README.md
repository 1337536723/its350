## Lab02: Classical cipher

__Description__

Get familiar with the source code for Caesar cipher and Simtran cipher, complete the following tasks in _Python interactive console_: 
Put the contents of plaintext or ciphertext in source code is _NOT allowed_.

* Write code to read and write text files in text mode
* Write code to demonstrate encryption and decryption on text file `military plan one.txt' with Caesar cipher
* Write code to demonstrate encryption and decryption on text file `military plan two.txt' with Caesar cipher
* Write code to demonstrate encryption and decryption on text file `military plan three.txt' with Caesar cipher
* Repeat the above tasks with Simtran cipher
	
__Report__

Write a report about the process you complete the tasks in the description, key screen snapshots are needed as evidences.

_Review questions:_

* How to define an appropriate alphabet in Caesar cipher? Why?
* In Simtran cipher, why an alphabet is NOT needed?
* How to avoid misleading blank spaces in both ciphers?
